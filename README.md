### 2. Cleaning data in database

### 3. 
## Results

The site will collect all the data related to analyze the user behaviour and the best product selling for their purpose.

Everytime user go to the website, the website will collect data of that transaction to store into the `all_sessions` table.

The `products` table stores the inventory information of the website. For example, what kind of product that they are selling and how many were sold, how many left in the inventory and time to restocking as well as the unit price of the products.
